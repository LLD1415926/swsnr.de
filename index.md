## What I do

I work as a software developer, mostly with Scala and Python, and
operator/system engineer for satellite mission planning.  I contribute to ground
systems of scientific satellite missions in my day job.

Outside of my job, I dabble with Rust and fiddle with my Arch Linux systems.
Sometimes I write about this here.

## What I enjoy

- Bouldering, though I'm much worse than I'd like to be.
- My single speed bike.
- Books about history and philosophy.
- The Disk World series by Terry Pratchett who passed away too early.  I love
  Nanny Ogg, Rincewind and Moist von Lipwig.
- Playing old video games. I still hope to go through Baldur's Gate 2 at least
  once in my life time, and I still enjoy the Gothic series.
- Playing AAA games sometimes.  Witcher 3 is an all time favorite; the central
  quest of the Heart of Stone expansion is _the single best thing_ I ever saw in
  a video came.
- Writing Rust code; the language and its tooling just do so many things right
  in my opinion.
- Arch Linux, because it's simple to set up, never gets in my way, and has a
  reasonable and pragmatic approach to distribution packaging.
