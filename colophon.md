This site is built with Jekyll because it was there first, works nice on GitHub,
has some reasonable plugins, and never gets in my way.

It runs on Github pages, because that's just there, has never let me down, and
works nice with Jekyll.

It uses the default minima theme, with some slight adjustments, because this
just works well, and I don't want to fiddle with CSS so much.
